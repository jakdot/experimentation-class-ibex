<div style="width: 40em;">
<p>In this experiment, you will be asked to read a number of English
sentences. Each sentence will be followed by 2 paraphrases.
You will be asked to select the best paraphrase of the sentence. Only one paraphrase can be chosen. Thus, in case you find both paraphrases possible, you should choose the one that seems more appropriate.<br>
</p>
<p>You can select the paraphrase by clicking on it with your mouse.</p>
<p>In selecting the best paraphrase of a sentence, you should consider how you would understand the sentence if someone uttered it. It usually helps to imagine the situation that the sentence describes and then to decide which of the paraphrases better fits the imagined situation. There are no right or wrong
answers here beyond your own intuition. You should answer each
question as quickly as you can, but without rushing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Consent to Participate</span>: I understand that identifying
information
will be recorded only for the purposes of being assigned course credit if I am
doing this experiment for credit. Otherwise, I will insert N/A in the
boxes&nbsp; below requiring to provide my name and the name of my course. Thus, if I am doing this experiment for credit, I understand that the
association between my name, my course name and the data I am providing
in this experiment is needed only so that the instructor(s) of my course can be informed that I have completed the
experiment and that I should be assigned course credit for it---in
particular, I understand that only the anonymized version of the data
will be used for any subsequent data analysis and / or publication of
results based on this experiment. I
understand that this experiment should not consume more than 30
minutes of my time, that I am free to stop at any point and that there
are no risks or discomforts expected to result from my participation in
this experiment. I understand that the information collected during this experiment will be stored in electronic and / or paper format indefinitely. I am an adult (18 years old or older).<br>
