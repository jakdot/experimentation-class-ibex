Here are a list of tasks to go through:

1. Download all the files
2. Go to http://spellout.net/ibexfarm/ and create an account
3. Create an experiment and upload the following files *from the folder Preference task*:
- example\_intro.html into chunk\_includes (overwrite the old file, if there is any)
- judgements.js into data\_includes (overwrite the old file, if there is any)
4. Go through the experiment once and inspect the results; after answering each of the following questions, check that the experiment still works, inspect the results
5. Add extra items to the experiment
6. Add extra fillers to the experiment
7. Modify the html form, add a new column to collect information
8. Add two more conditions per item (e.g., another quantifer)
9. Create a second experiment and upload the following files *from the folder Acceptability*:
- example\_intro.html into chunk\_includes (overwrite the old file, if there is any)
- global\_stylesheet.css into css\_includes (not obligatory)
- judgements.js into data\_includes (overwrite the old file, if there is any)
10. Go through the experiment once and inspect the results
11. We now want to test that each has the differentiation condition, unlike every. Think of a way to test this in Acceptability task *that does not involve inverse quantifier scope*.
12. Write a few items following your idea. Create at least one full loop for the Latin square (you have to have as many items as conditions).
13. Add two fillers and change the scale to have 7 points.
